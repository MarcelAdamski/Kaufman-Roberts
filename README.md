# Kaufman-Roberts
This project is a implementation of a mathematical model determining the probability of a blockade in a system with fully available resources with flexible and adaptive movement. Made for educational purposes only for a Designing ICT Networks subject.

## About
In its final form, the project is based on the Kaufman-Roberts model, which was extended as part of the development of given models - for flexible and adaptive movement, respectively. The result is two separate routines that implement system models for both of these movements.
